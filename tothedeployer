Please this is for the deployer please first create a database with a model attached to the files I sent him and then deploy the database on the server then deploy the flask app on the server 
I installed flask by using pip install flask 

and then please after that deploy the twitter bot attached to it 

not that the bot will run every 5 mins and look for unread messages for every users on the web APP 
I used Tweepy.. Actually the modules are in the twitter file so no p 

and then please I think that is all

but remember deploy the flask first before the twitter app itself and Change the database credentials in the the twitterbot.py and the app.py to the database deployed and also please I used mysql workbench  to create the model so please make sure you use  the model I created thank 


It is easy tho 

But I can sick that is why he decided to give it to you 

so please after everything tell me so that I can add the callback url to my twitter developer account 

and then you will restart the server again please that is alll
