# First create a database and then deploy the database on the server then deploy the flask app on the server 
I installed flask by using pip install flask and then after that deploy the twitter bot attached to it 

Note that the bot will run every 5 mins and look for unread messages for every users in the database for the webapp.

I used Tweepy, other modules are in the twitter file.

Remember deploy flask first before the twitter app itself and Change the database credentials in the the twitterbot.py and the app.py to the database deployed.

Then please after everything tell me so that I can add the callback url to my twitter developer account. 

And then you will restart the server again.
